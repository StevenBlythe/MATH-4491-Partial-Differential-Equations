\item If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are changed on the region $x \in [0, 4]$, on which region in the $(x, t)-$plane will the solutions of $u_{tt} = 9u_{xx}$ be altered?

%____________________________________________________________________________%
Here, we are given a wave equation on the $x$ boundary $[0, 4]$ and a constant $3^2$. $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are given to determine the initial condition for our system. When changing our initial conditions, we change the Fourier Series solutions for the given problem. Altering $f(x)$ will change our coefficients for $u(x,0)$ and $g(x)$ will change our coefficients for $u_t(x, 0)$.
