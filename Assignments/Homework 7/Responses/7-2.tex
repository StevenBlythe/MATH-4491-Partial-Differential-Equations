\item If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are changed on the region $x \in [0, 4]$, on which region in the $(x, t)-$plane will the solutions of $u_{tt} = 9u_{xx}$ be altered?

%____________________________________________________________________________%
Here, we are given a wave equation on the $x$ boundary $[0, 4]$ and a constant $3^2$. $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are given to determine the initial condition for our system. When changing our initial conditions, we change the Fourier Series solutions for the given problem. Altering $f(x)$ and $g(x)$

Here, let us consider our wave equation, $u_{tt} = 9u_{xx}$, where $\sqrt{c} = 3$.

Here, let us consider our characteristic line as we pass through $(0,0)$. Let us write $x \pm 3t = 0$, which would give us $t = \pm \frac{1}{3} x$.

Now, looking for the characteristic line passing through $(3, 0)$, we can write $x \pm 2t = 3$, yielding
