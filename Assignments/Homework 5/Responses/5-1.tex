\item Prove the maximum principle using the Mean Value Theorem(s). If $\Delta u = 0$ on a bounded domain $\Omega$, show that
%
\begin{align}
  \max_{x \in \Omega} u(x) = \max_{x \in \p \Omega} u(x)
\end{align}
In other words, the max of a harmonic function is attained on its boundary. Hint: Use proof by contradiction.

Here, let us consider our given statement from line 1. We are given the assumption that for a point in a given area, $\Omega$, there is a point that gives us the max $u(\text{point})$.

Here, let us consider the area $\Omega$, where $\Omega$ is any closed area.
For the sake of coding these graphs, let us assume our boundary assumes the shape of a circle %an ellipse

\begin{center}
  + $\Omega$ % Idea: Had a circle in Q1 with \Omega in the center of the circle
\end{center}

Now, let us consider a point within this interval, $x_0$. Here, let us consider point $x_0$ to be an arbitrary point within our area, $\Omega$:

\begin{center}
  % Move $x_0$ around \Omega
\end{center}

To begin, let us consider a neighborhood, or ball, around our point, $x_0$. Here, our ball around $x_0$, has a radius $\eps$, where $\eps > 0$, and the area of our ball is a subset of $\Omega$.

\begin{center}
  % Static x_0 point, change the size of \eps, spanning from x_0 to \p \Omega
\end{center}
