\item Prove the maximum principle using the Mean Value Theorem(s). If $\Delta u = 0$ on a bounded domain $\Omega$, show that
%
\begin{align}
  \max_{x \in \Omega} u(x) = \max_{x \in \p \Omega} u(x)
\end{align}
In other words, the max of a harmonic function is attained on its boundary. Hint: Use proof by contradiction.

Here, let us consider the given equation: the max of $u(x)$ is the same when $x$ is within $\Omega$ and when $x$ is on the boundary of $\Omega$.

Here, $x$ has a maximum at some $x_0$, where $x_0 \in \Omega$. Here, we can write:
%
\begin{align}
  u(x_0) & = \max_{x \in \Omega} u(x) = a
\end{align}

Now, let us consider the same for the boundary of $\Omega$, writing the following:
%
\begin{align}
  \max_{x \in \p \Omega} u(x) = b
\end{align}

Here, the max at the boundary is $b$.
